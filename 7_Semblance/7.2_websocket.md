It looks like you're trying to run a Python script (`run.py`), but it seems like the `websocket` module is missing. You can install it using `pip`, which is Python's package installer.

To fix this, run the following command to install the `websocket-client` package:

```bash
pip3 install websocket-client
```

Once it's installed, try running your script again with:


rifaterdemsahin@Rifats-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd Downloads 
rifaterdemsahin@Rifats-MacBook-Pro Downloads % python3 run.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/rifaterdemsahin/Downloads/run.py", line 1, in <module>
    import websocket
rifaterdemsahin@Rifats-MacBook-Pro Downloads % python3 run.pypip3 install websocket-client

Let me know if that works or if you run into any other issues!
