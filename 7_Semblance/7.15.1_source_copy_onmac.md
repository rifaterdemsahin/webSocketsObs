Apple could not verify “source-copy-0.2.5-macos-arm64.pkg” is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.

The warning you're seeing is a security feature in macOS called **Gatekeeper**. Gatekeeper ensures that only trusted software runs on your Mac by verifying that the app or installer is from an identified developer and has not been tampered with. If you're seeing this message, it means the `.pkg` file you're trying to open is not signed by Apple or a recognized developer, or it hasn't been notarized by Apple.

Here’s how you can proceed:

---

### **Option 1: Bypass the Warning (Proceed at Your Own Risk)**
If you trust the source of the `.pkg` file and want to install it anyway:
1. Open **System Settings** (or **System Preferences** on older macOS versions).
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
4. You should see a message like:
   > "source-copy-0.2.5-macos-arm64.pkg" was blocked because it is not from an identified developer.
5. Click **Open Anyway** to proceed with the installation.

### **Option 2: Use the `xattr` Command to Remove the Quarantine Flag**
macOS marks downloaded files with a "quarantine" attribute to ensure they are checked by Gatekeeper. You can remove this attribute using the Terminal:
1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/source-copy-0.2.5-macos-arm64.pkg
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to the `.pkg` file.
3. Try opening the `.pkg` file again.

---

### **Option 3: Disable Gatekeeper Temporarily (Not Recommended)**
You can disable Gatekeeper temporarily to allow the installation, but this is **not recommended** as it reduces your Mac's security:
1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo spctl --master-disable
   ```
3. Install the `.pkg` file.
4. Re-enable Gatekeeper after installation:
   ```bash
   sudo spctl --master-enable
   ```

---

### **Option 4: Verify the Source**
If you’re unsure about the `.pkg` file:
1. Double-check where you downloaded it from. Only download software from trusted sources.
2. Look for a checksum (e.g., SHA256) provided by the developer and verify it matches the file you downloaded. You can calculate the checksum using:
   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 /path/to/source-copy-0.2.5-macos-arm64.pkg
   ```

---

### **Option 5: Contact the Developer**
If the software is from a legitimate developer, they may need to update their app to comply with Apple's notarization requirements. Reach out to them and ask if they can provide a signed or notarized version of the `.pkg`.

### **Important Note**
Proceed with caution when bypassing macOS security features. Running untrusted software can compromise your Mac's security and privacy. Always ensure you trust the source of the file before proceeding.
