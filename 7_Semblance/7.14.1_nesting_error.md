Looking at the code, I notice that the payload structure in the `change_image` method appears to be incorrect for the OBS WebSocket protocol. Let me explain:



```python
def change_image(self, input_uuid, image_path):
    if not self.authenticated:
        logging.error("Not authenticated yet")
        return

    payload = {
        "op": 6,
        "d": {
            "requestType": "SetInputSettings",
            "requestId": "change_image",
            "requestData": {  # Add this nested level
                "inputName": "XIMAGEX",
                "inputUuid": input_uuid,
                "inputSettings": {
                    "file": image_path
                }
            }
        }
    }
    self.send_request(payload)
    logging.info(f"Image change request sent for {image_path}")

```

The issue is that the OBS WebSocket protocol v5.0+ expects the actual request data to be nested under a `requestData` field within the `d` object. In your current code, you're putting the input settings directly under `d`, which isn't the correct structure.

The key changes made are:
1. Added a `requestData` object inside the `d` field
2. Moved the input-related fields (`inputName`, `inputUuid`, `inputSettings`) under `requestData`
3. Fixed the variable name from `inputUuid` to `input_uuid` to match the parameter name

This should properly structure the request according to the OBS WebSocket protocol specification. Would you like me to explain more about the protocol structure or help with any other aspects of the code?
