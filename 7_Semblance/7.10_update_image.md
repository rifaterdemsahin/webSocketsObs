I see the issue. The problem is in the execution order. The change_image command is being called after connect(), but connect() starts a WebSocket connection and blocks (runs forever). This means the code after connect() never gets executed.
Let's modify the code to call change_image after authentication is successful:
Fixed OBS WebSocket ClientClick to open code
Key changes made:

Moved the change_image call inside the handle_authentication method, so it runs right after authentication is successful
Removed the redundant OBSWebSocket creation in the main block
Added more logging to track the image change process
Fixed the execution flow to ensure the image change happens at the right time

Also, please verify in OBS that:

You have an image source named exactly "Image" (case sensitive)
The path "/Users/rifaterdemsahin/Downloads/expense16_taxi.jpeg" is correct and accessible
The WebSocket server is enabled in OBS (Tools > WebSocket Server Settings)
> enable!

Try running this updated version and let me know if you see any specific errors in the logs.
