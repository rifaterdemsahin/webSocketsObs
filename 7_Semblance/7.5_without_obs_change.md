The error message `{"status":"error","error":"missing request parameters"}` indicates that your request is missing required parameters. This usually happens when the WebSocket request structure isnâ€™t properly set according to OBS WebSocket's expected format.

Looking at your script, the issue seems to be that the `change_image_payload` for setting the image file (`"file": image_file_path`) might not be correctly formed, or required parameters are missing.

### Here's how to fix it:

#### 1. **Check Authentication Response**
   The OBS WebSocket expects an authentication response after sending the password. You should check the response to confirm that authentication was successful. If authentication fails, the subsequent requests might not be processed correctly.

   Let's improve your code to handle that:

```python
def on_message(ws, message):
    print("Received message:", message)
    response = json.loads(message)
    
    # Check if authentication was successful (response code 7 is for authentication)
    if 'op' in response and response['op'] == 7:
        print("Authentication successful!")
    elif 'status' in response and response['status'] == 'error':
        print(f"Error from OBS: {response['error']}")
```

#### 2. **Ensure Correct Payload for Changing Image**
   The `change_image_payload` you're sending is expected to follow a specific format, which may be causing issues. You should double-check the correct structure by consulting the [OBS WebSocket API documentation](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/master/docs/generated/protocol.md).

   Here's a better-structured request for changing a source image:

Wring schema!!!

```python
# Set the new image for the source
change_image_payload = {
    "op": 6,  # Set source settings request
    "d": {
        "sourceName": source_name,
        "sourceSettings": {
            "file": image_file_path,
            "rate": 1  # Additional settings, check your OBS source type if needed
        }
    }
}
```

The `rate` parameter is optional and specific to some source types, but I added it to provide an example of what might be required based on your OBS source.

#### 3. **Debugging Authentication**
   After sending the authentication request, verify the response. You may want to print out the authentication response to see if there are any additional issues with the password or WebSocket connection.

Here's the updated code:

```python
import websocket
import json

OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL = "ws://localhost:4444"  # OBS WebSocket URL
OBS_PASSWORD = "XXX"  # Your OBS WebSocket password, leave empty if no password

def send_request(ws, request):
    ws.send(json.dumps(request))

def on_open(ws):
    print("WebSocket connection opened")

    # Authenticate if password is set
    if OBS_PASSWORD:
        auth_payload = {
            "op": 1,  # Authentication request
            "d": {
                "password": OBS_PASSWORD
            }
        }
        send_request(ws, auth_payload)
    else:
        print("No password set, skipping authentication")
    
    source_name = "YourImageSource"  # Name of your source in OBS
    image_file_path = "path_to_new_image.png"  # Path to your new image file

    # Set the new image for the source
    change_image_payload = {
        "op": 6,  # Set source settings request
        "d": {
            "sourceName": source_name,
            "sourceSettings": {
                "file": image_file_path
            }
        }
    }

    send_request(ws, change_image_payload)

def on_message(ws, message):
    print("Received message:", message)
    response = json.loads(message)

    if 'op' in response and response['op'] == 7:
        print("Authentication successful!")
    elif 'status' in response and response['status'] == 'error':
        print(f"Error from OBS: {response['error']}")

def on_error(ws, error):
    print("Error:", error)

def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
    print("WebSocket connection closed")

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
    OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL,
    on_open=on_open,
    on_message=on_message,
    on_error=on_error,
    on_close=on_close
)

ws.run_forever()
```

#### 4. **Testing Connection**
Once you have updated your code:
- Run the script again (`python3 run.py`).
- Make sure the WebSocket server is running on the correct port (`4444` by default).
- If you still see errors, check the response to make sure authentication succeeds first.

#### If the issue persists:
- Double-check the source name (`YourImageSource`) in OBS to ensure it matches the exact name of the image source you're trying to control.
- Ensure the image path (`path_to_new_image.png`) is correct and the file is accessible.

Let me know if this works, or if you're still seeing any issues!
