It looks like your Python script is attempting to interact with OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) using its WebSocket interface, but there may be an issue either with the WebSocket connection or the OBS WebSocket server setup.

### Here's a checklist to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

#### 1. **Install WebSocket Client**
   Make sure the `websocket-client` package is installed correctly. You can try reinstalling it just to be sure:

   ```bash
   pip3 install --upgrade websocket-client
   ```

#### 2. **OBS WebSocket Plugin**
   Ensure that the **OBS WebSocket** plugin is installed and running in OBS. To check or install it:

   - Go to the [OBS WebSocket GitHub page](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket) and follow the instructions for installation.
   - After installation, ensure that the WebSocket server is running. You can check this in **OBS Settings** > **WebSocket** section (ensure it’s listening on port `4444` or the correct one).

#### 3. **Check WebSocket URL and Password**
   In your script, make sure:
   - The WebSocket URL (`ws://localhost:4444`) is correct. If you changed the port or are connecting remotely, adjust the URL accordingly.
   - If you have set a password in the OBS WebSocket settings, make sure it matches what is in the `OBS_PASSWORD` variable in your script. If no password is set, leave it empty.

#### 4. **Handle Authentication Response**
   The script you're using sends an authentication request to OBS (if a password is set), but there’s no feedback for whether the authentication was successful. You can enhance the `on_message` function to capture this response and check for errors:

   Add to the `on_message` function:
   ```python
   def on_message(ws, message):
       print("Received message:", message)
       response = json.loads(message)

       # Check if authentication is successful
       if 'op' in response and response['op'] == 7:
           print("Authentication successful!")
   ```

#### 5. **Test the WebSocket Connection**
   Before running your script, ensure the WebSocket server is properly running by connecting to it using a WebSocket client (such as [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat) or a browser-based tool) and verify if the connection works.

   For example:
   ```bash
   websocat ws://localhost:4444
   ```

   If the connection works via websocat, then your OBS WebSocket server is functioning, and the issue is likely in the Python script.

#### 6. **Check for Errors in `on_error`**
   You can add more detailed logging in the `on_error` function to capture any connection issues:

   ```python
   def on_error(ws, error):
       print("Error:", error)
       # If error is a traceback or error details, you may want to log it more fully
   ```

### Example Enhanced Code
Here’s a slightly improved version of your code that includes some of the above tips:

```python
import websocket
import json

OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL = "ws://localhost:4444"
OBS_PASSWORD = "XXX"  # Leave empty if no password set

def send_request(ws, request):
    ws.send(json.dumps(request))

def on_open(ws):
    print("WebSocket connection opened")
    if OBS_PASSWORD:
        auth_payload = {
            "op": 1,
            "d": {"password": OBS_PASSWORD}
        }
        send_request(ws, auth_payload)
    else:
        print("No password set, skipping authentication")

    source_name = "YourImageSource"  
    image_file_path = "path_to_new_image.png"

    change_image_payload = {
        "op": 6,  
        "d": {
            "sourceName": source_name,
            "sourceSettings": {"file": image_file_path}
        }
    }

    send_request(ws, change_image_payload)

def on_message(ws, message):
    print("Received message:", message)
    response = json.loads(message)

    if 'op' in response and response['op'] == 7:
        print("Authentication successful!")

def on_error(ws, error):
    print("Error:", error)

def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
    print("WebSocket connection closed")

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
    OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL,
    on_open=on_open,
    on_message=on_message,
    on_error=on_error,
    on_close=on_close
)

ws.run_forever()
```

#### After Making Changes:
- Try running your script again using `python3 run.py`.
- If you're still encountering issues, check the error message from `on_error()` for more detailed information on what might be wrong.
