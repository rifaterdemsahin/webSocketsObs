Your updated code looks good! You've included both `inputName` and `inputUuid` in the payload for the `change_image` method. This should help ensure that one of them is recognized correctly by the OBS WebSocket server.

Here's a quick summary of the key changes:
- The `change_image` method now includes both `inputName` and `inputUuid` in the payload.
- The `inputName` is set to `"XIMAGEX"`, which matches the name of your image source in the scene.

Try running the updated code and see if it resolves the issue. If you encounter any further problems, feel free to share the error messages, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot!
