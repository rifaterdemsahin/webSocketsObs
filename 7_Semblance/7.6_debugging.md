To add debugging to your WebSocket client script, you can include print statements or use a logging library to track the flow of execution and capture any issues. Below is your script with added debugging statements using the `logging` module, which provides more flexibility and control over the output.

```python
import websocket
import json
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Replace with your OBS WebSocket server details
OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL = "ws://localhost:4444"  # URL to your OBS WebSocket server
OBS_PASSWORD = "XXX"  # Password if you set one, leave empty if not

# Function to send a request to OBS WebSocket
def send_request(ws, request):
    logging.debug(f"Sending request: {json.dumps(request)}")
    ws.send(json.dumps(request))

# Open WebSocket connection to OBS
def on_open(ws):
    logging.info("WebSocket connection opened")
    
    # Authenticate if password is set
    if OBS_PASSWORD:
        auth_payload = {
            "op": 1,  # Authentication request
            "d": {
                "password": OBS_PASSWORD
            }
        }
        logging.debug("Attempting to authenticate...")
        send_request(ws, auth_payload)

    # Change image source (you must know the source name in OBS)
    source_name = "Image"  # The name of the image source in OBS
    image_file_path = "/Users/rifaterdemsahin/Downloads/expense16_taxi.jpeg"  # Path to your new image file

    # Set the new image for the source
    change_image_payload = {
        "op": 6,  # Set source settings request
        "d": {
            "sourceName": source_name,
            "sourceSettings": {
                "file": image_file_path
            }
        }
    }

    logging.debug(f"Changing image source '{source_name}' to '{image_file_path}'")
    send_request(ws, change_image_payload)

def on_message(ws, message):
    logging.info(f"Received message: {message}")

def on_error(ws, error):
    logging.error(f"Error: {error}")

def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
    logging.info(f"Closed connection with status code {close_status_code}: {close_msg}")

# Create WebSocket connection to OBS
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
    OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL,
    on_open=on_open,
    on_message=on_message,
    on_error=on_error,
    on_close=on_close
)

# Run the WebSocket client
logging.info("Starting WebSocket client...")
ws.run_forever()
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Logging Setup**: 
   - The `logging` module is configured to output messages with a timestamp, log level, and the message itself.
   - The log level is set to `DEBUG` to capture all levels of messages.

2. **Debugging Statements**:
   - Added `logging.debug`, `logging.info`, and `logging.error` statements to track the flow of execution and capture any issues.
   - For example, `logging.debug(f"Sending request: {json.dumps(request)}")` logs the exact request being sent to the WebSocket server.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The `on_error` function logs errors using `logging.error`, which will help you identify issues during execution.

### Running the Script:
- When you run the script, you'll see detailed logs in the console, which will help you debug any issues with the WebSocket connection, authentication, or image source changes.

### Example Output:
```
2023-10-05 12:34:56,789 - INFO - Starting WebSocket client...
2023-10-05 12:34:56,790 - INFO - WebSocket connection opened
2023-10-05 12:34:56,791 - DEBUG - Attempting to authenticate...
2023-10-05 12:34:56,792 - DEBUG - Sending request: {"op": 1, "d": {"password": "XXX"}}
2023-10-05 12:34:56,793 - DEBUG - Changing image source 'Image' to '/Users/rifaterdemsahin/Downloads/expense16_taxi.jpeg'
2023-10-05 12:34:56,794 - DEBUG - Sending request: {"op": 6, "d": {"sourceName": "Image", "sourceSettings": {"file": "/Users/rifaterdemsahin/Downloads/expense16_taxi.jpeg"}}}
2023-10-05 12:34:56,795 - INFO - Received message: {"status": "ok"}
```

This output will help you trace the execution and identify where things might be going wrong.
