To create 95 MB files in OBS Studio when the file grows, you can use the **"Automatically split output into files of a specific size"** feature. This allows OBS to create new files once the current file reaches a specified size (in your case, 95 MB). Here's how to set it up:

### Steps to Create 95 MB Files in OBS:

1. **Open OBS Studio**:
   - Launch OBS on your computer.

2. **Go to Settings**:
   - Click on the **Settings** button in the bottom-right corner of the OBS window.

3. **Navigate to the Output Tab**:
   - In the Settings window, select the **Output** tab on the left-hand side.

4. **Change Output Mode to Advanced**:
   - At the top of the Output tab, change the **Output Mode** from "Simple" to **Advanced**.

5. **Configure Recording Settings**:
   - Under the **Recording** section, find the setting labeled **Automatically split output into files of a specific size**.
   - Enable this option by checking the box.

6. **Set the File Size**:
   - In the box next to the option, enter the size you want for each file. Since you want 95 MB files, enter **95** and make sure the unit is set to **MB**.

7. **Choose a File Path**:
   - Make sure the **Recording Path** is set to a location where you want the files to be saved.

8. **Apply and Save**:
   - Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save your settings.

### How It Works:
- OBS will now automatically create a new file once the current recording reaches 95 MB. The files will be saved in the specified folder with sequential names (e.g., `filename-001.mp4`, `filename-002.mp4`, etc.).

### Additional Notes:
- **File Format**: Ensure you're using a file format that supports splitting, such as MP4 or MKV.
- **Encoding Settings**: If you're using high-quality settings, the file size may grow quickly, so adjust your bitrate and resolution accordingly to achieve the desired file size.
- **Testing**: Test the setup by recording a short session to confirm that OBS splits the files correctly at 95 MB.
