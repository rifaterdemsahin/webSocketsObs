To embed a video in Markdown, you generally link to the video or use an HTML tag (since Markdown doesn't support video embedding directly). Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. **Link to a Video (e.g., YouTube)**:
You can link to a video with a clickable image or plain text link.

#### Example with text link:
```markdown
[Watch the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example)
```

#### Example with image link (showing a thumbnail):
```markdown
[![Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/example/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example)
```

### 2. **Embed a Video Using HTML (If supported)**:
You can directly embed a video using HTML inside your Markdown file. This method works in many places where Markdown allows HTML, like GitHub or certain blog platforms.

#### Example with HTML:
```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/example" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

### 3. **Local Video File** (if you're using a file that is locally available or hosted somewhere):
You can also embed a local video (e.g., `.mp4` file), but it depends on the platform you're using.

```markdown
![Video](video.mp4)
```
