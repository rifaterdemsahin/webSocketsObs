The code snippet you provided is already importing the necessary libraries for working with WebSockets, JSON, logging, base64 encoding, and hashing. However, it seems like you might be missing the `websocket-client` library, which is commonly used for WebSocket communication in Python.

To use the `websocket` module, you need to install the `websocket-client` library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install websocket-client
```

Once installed, you can import it in your script as follows:

```python
import websocket
import json
import logging
import base64
import hashlib

# [Previous OBSWebSocket class code remains the same...]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create the WebSocket client
    obs_ws = OBSWebSocket("ws://localhost:4444", "XXX")
```

### Explanation of the Libraries:
- **`websocket`**: This is the main library for WebSocket communication. It allows you to create WebSocket clients and servers.
- **`json`**: This library is used for encoding and decoding JSON data, which is commonly used in WebSocket communication.
- **`logging`**: This library is used for logging messages, which can be helpful for debugging and monitoring the application.
- **`base64`**: This library is used for encoding and decoding data in Base64 format, which is sometimes used in WebSocket communication for binary data.
- **`hashlib`**: This library provides common hashing algorithms like SHA-1, SHA-256, etc., which might be used for authentication or data integrity checks.

### Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how you might use these libraries together:

```python
import websocket
import json
import logging
import base64
import hashlib

class OBSWebSocket:
    def __init__(self, url, password):
        self.url = url
        self.password = password
        self.ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(url,
                                         on_message=self.on_message,
                                         on_error=self.on_error,
                                         on_close=self.on_close)
        self.ws.on_open = self.on_open

    def on_message(self, ws, message):
        print(f"Received: {message}")

    def on_error(self, ws, error):
        print(f"Error: {error}")

    def on_close(self, ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
        print("### closed ###")

    def on_open(self, ws):
        print("Connection opened")
        # Example: Send a message after connection is opened
        self.ws.send(json.dumps({"request-type": "GetVersion", "message-id": "1"}))

    def run(self):
        self.ws.run_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create the WebSocket client
    obs_ws = OBSWebSocket("ws://localhost:4444", "XXX")
    obs_ws.run()
```

This example sets up a WebSocket connection to an OBS WebSocket server, sends a message to get the version, and prints any messages received from the server. Adjust the URL and password as needed for your specific use case.
