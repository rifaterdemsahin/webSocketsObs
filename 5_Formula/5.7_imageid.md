It looks like you're trying to work with an OBS WebSocket request and receiving a `300` error, indicating that the request to change the image source is missing required fields, specifically either `inputName` or `inputUuid`. This error message is saying that OBS expects at least one of these fields in the request when trying to modify the settings for an input (like an image).

To solve this, we need to provide the correct parameters when making the WebSocket call to OBS. Let me break this down for you.

### 1. **Understanding the Error**

The error message you received:

```
"comment": "Your request must contain at least one of the following fields: `inputName` or `inputUuid`."
```

This means that OBS is expecting the request to include either:
- **`inputName`**: The name of the input you want to change.
- **`inputUuid`**: The unique identifier (UUID) of the input you want to change.

Since you're trying to change an image, you need to provide the correct `inputName` or `inputUuid` for the image source in OBS.

### 2. **Correcting the Request**

When you send a WebSocket request to OBS to change an image, you need to reference the image source using its name (`inputName`) or UUID (`inputUuid`). Here's the corrected approach.

### 3. **How to Find the Input Name or Input UUID**

#### **Finding the Input Name**

- Open OBS.
- In the **Sources** panel, find the image source you want to modify.
- Right-click on the image source and click **Properties**.
- The **name** of the source is what you need for the WebSocket request, so make sure to use the exact name (e.g., `Image Source 1`).

#### **Finding the Input UUID (Optional)**

You can also use the **UUID** for the input, but you’ll first need to retrieve it from OBS.

To get the UUID, you’ll need to query OBS for the list of inputs (sources) and their details.

You can do this by sending a request to the WebSocket server to get a list of inputs. Here's how:

### 4. **Get Input List via WebSocket**

To get the list of all available sources (including images), you can send a request to OBS like this:

```python
# Query to get a list of all inputs
get_inputs_payload = {
    "op": 6,  # List all inputs request
    "d": {}
}
send_request(ws, get_inputs_payload)
```

The response will contain details about each input, including the `inputName` and `inputUuid` for every source.

#### Example Response:

```json
{
  "op": 7,
  "d": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "inputName": "Image Source 1",
        "inputUuid": "some-uuid-value",
        "inputKind": "image_source",
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5. **Correct WebSocket Payload to Change Image**

Once you have either the **`inputName`** or **`inputUuid`**, you can modify the request to change the image.

Here’s an example of how to modify your payload to use the **`inputName`**:

```python
# Payload to change image source
change_image_payload = {
    "op": 7,  # SetInputSettings request
    "d": {
        "inputName": "YourImageSource",  # Replace with your source name
        "inputSettings": {
            "file": "path_to_new_image.png"  # Path to the new image file
        }
    }
}

send_request(ws, change_image_payload)
```

### 6. **Steps Recap**

1. **Find the correct `inputName` or `inputUuid`**:
   - Check the image source name in OBS.
   - Optionally, retrieve all inputs through a WebSocket call and get the UUID.

2. **Modify the payload to include the `inputName` or `inputUuid`** in the request.

3. **Send the request to OBS** using WebSocket to change the image source.

### Example with the Corrected WebSocket Request:

```python
import websocket
import json

# WebSocket URL and password
OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL = "ws://localhost:4444"
OBS_PASSWORD = "your_password"

# Function to send requests to OBS
def send_request(ws, request):
    ws.send(json.dumps(request))

# WebSocket connection setup
def on_open(ws):
    # Authenticate if needed
    if OBS_PASSWORD:
        auth_payload = {
            "op": 1,
            "d": {"password": OBS_PASSWORD}
        }
        send_request(ws, auth_payload)

    # Change the image source with the correct inputName
    source_name = "YourImageSource"  # The name of your image source in OBS
    image_file_path = "path_to_new_image.png"  # Path to your new image

    # Set the new image for the source
    change_image_payload = {
        "op": 7,  # SetInputSettings request
        "d": {
            "inputName": source_name,  # Correct input name
            "inputSettings": {
                "file": image_file_path  # New image path
            }
        }
    }

    send_request(ws, change_image_payload)

# WebSocket callback functions
def on_message(ws, message):
    print("Received message:", message)

def on_error(ws, error):
    print("Error:", error)

def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
    print("Closed connection")

# Create WebSocket client
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
    OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL,
    on_open=on_open,
    on_message=on_message,
    on_error=on_error,
    on_close=on_close
)

# Run the WebSocket client
ws.run_forever()
```

### Final Thoughts:

The key to fixing your error is making sure you’re sending either the `inputName` or `inputUuid` in the request. You can use the exact name of the image source or retrieve the UUID programmatically. Once you include the correct field, your image should change successfully in OBS.
