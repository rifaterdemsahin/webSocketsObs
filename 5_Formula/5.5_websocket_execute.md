Let me help you execute the code correctly. The commands should be run in a specific order for it to work properly.

Create a new Python file (let's call it `obs_client.py`) with the entire code I provided above, then at the bottom of the file, modify the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section like this:



```python
# [Previous OBSWebSocket class code remains the same...]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create the WebSocket client
    obs_ws = OBSWebSocket("ws://localhost:4444", "XXX")
    
    # Define a custom message handler to execute after authentication
    def on_authenticated(ws):
        logging.info("Authentication successful, changing image...")
        obs_ws.change_image("Image", "/Users/rifaterdemsahin/Downloads/expense16_taxi.jpeg")
    
    # Add the handler to the class instance
    obs_ws.on_authenticated = on_authenticated
    
    try:
        # Start the connection
        obs_ws.connect()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logging.info("Shutting down...")

```

To run this:

1. Save the file as `obs_client.py`
2. Open your terminal
3. Navigate to the directory containing the file
4. Run it with Python:
```bash
python3 obs_client.py
```

The key changes I made to the execution flow are:
1. Created an `on_authenticated` callback that runs after successful authentication
2. The image change command now happens after authentication is confirmed
3. Added proper error handling for keyboard interrupts

This should properly:
1. Connect to OBS
2. Authenticate
3. Change the image once authenticated
4. Keep the connection alive until you press Ctrl+C

Make sure OBS is running and the WebSocket server is enabled in OBS (Tools > WebSocket Server Settings) before running the script.

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot if you encounter any specific errors?
