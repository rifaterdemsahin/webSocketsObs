To accomplish the tasks outlined in your guide, you will need to create specific prompts for each step. Below are the prompts you can use to generate the necessary instructions, code, or explanations for each todo item:

---

### 1. **Install the OBS WebSocket Plugin**
   - **Prompt:**  
     "Provide step-by-step instructions for downloading, installing, and configuring the OBS WebSocket plugin. Include how to enable the WebSocket server in OBS, set a password, and configure the port."

---

### 2. **Set up a WebSocket Client**
   - **Prompt:**  
     "Explain how to install Python and the `websocket-client` library. Include commands for installing the library using pip and any prerequisites for setting up a WebSocket client."

---

### 3. **Change Image Using WebSockets**
   - **Prompt:**  
     "Write a Python script that connects to OBS via WebSockets and changes an image source. Include placeholders for the WebSocket server address, password, and image file path."

---

### 4. **Explanation of the Script**
   - **Prompt:**  
     "Explain the Python script for changing an image source in OBS using WebSockets. Break down the functions, payloads, and how the script interacts with the OBS WebSocket API."

---

### 5. **Run the Script**
   - **Prompt:**  
     "Provide instructions for running the Python script to change an image source in OBS. Include how to replace placeholders like the WebSocket server address, password, and image file path."

---

### 6. **Verify in OBS**
   - **Prompt:**  
     "Explain how to verify that the image source has been successfully updated in OBS after running the WebSocket script. Include steps to check the OBS preview or output."

---

### 7. **Troubleshooting**
   - **Prompt:**  
     "List common issues users might encounter when setting up OBS WebSocket or running the Python script, along with troubleshooting tips. Include solutions for connection errors, authentication issues, and script failures."

---

### Additional Notes:
- For each prompt, you can specify the level of detail you need (e.g., beginner-friendly, advanced).
- If you want code snippets, include that in the prompt (e.g., "Provide a Python script for...").
- If you need explanations for specific parts of the process, tailor the prompts accordingly.
